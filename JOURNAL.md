description: "I am making SmartBin AI, which is a project that can analyse both the type and percentage of food waste occurring at a school campus/canteen/kitchen. This project will use a Raspberry Pi, as well as its Module 2 camera to capture the image, after taking photos, it will run a Region of Interest (ROI) analysis on all images to find out which photos has plates. After receiving such list of images, it will pass all of them through the OpenAI o4 model and find out what kind of food it is, as well as the percentage of waste."
